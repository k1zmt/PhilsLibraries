# Phil's Collection of KiCAD Libraries


Disclaimer: Use this shit at your own risk. If you a copyright nerd then go fuck yourself and don't waste my time.

## For Normal People

There is some stuff I found online in random places and there is a whole bunch of things I have drawn myself. 

Unfortunately, KiCAD team made a stupid decision to move off GitHub hence I hate chasing them. 

Plus I got sick dealing with their pull requests' reviews. 

Instead of making a community managed cloud components library they've stuck with symbols stored in git. 
Probably makes sense for some old folks.


## Installation

1. Clone the repo or download the latest ZIP-archive.
2. Configure directories

   Go to KiCAD, menu `Preferences` - `Configure paths`:
   ```
   KICAD7_USER_3DMODEL_DIR=path/to/the/cloned/repo/packages3d
   ```
